Within the context of the partnership, your counterpart's personal motivations may revolve around 

- Achieving personal growth
- Gaining internal recognition 
- Financial benefit through commissions or bonuses
- Expanding their network 
- Enhancing their resume
- Gaining valuable experience managing partnerships. 

So, my question to you is, do you know?  Have you taken the time to learn about your partner and their motivations?  You might help by being a reliable and supportive collaborator, providing necessary resources, sharing industry insights, and actively contributing to the partnership and consequently, to their success.

When empathy is present in the partnership, it leads to better communication and decision-making. Partners who empathize with one another are more likely to listen actively, appreciate different viewpoints, and seek mutually beneficial outcomes. They understand that success is not a zero-sum game and that their collective achievements depend on mutually beneficial success.

Empathy enables partners to navigate through challenging situations. Inevitably, obstacles and conflicts arise in any partnership, but an empathetic approach allows partners to resolve issues constructively. By acknowledging and addressing the concerns and emotions of your counterpart, you can build resilience and maintain a healthy working relationship.

Ultimately, the role of empathy in channel partnerships is to transcend superficial trust and foster a deeper, more meaningful connection. It requires partners to invest time and effort in understanding one another, recognizing shared goals, and aligning actions accordingly. Through empathy, partners can build trust that is grounded in mutual respect, support, and a genuine desire for shared success.
