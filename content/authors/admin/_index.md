I specialize in channel development and revenue generation for small-to-mid-sized independent software vendors (ISVs). As the founder of Channel Motions Consulting, I assist ISVs in creating, developing, and expanding indirect channels to market, leveraging my expertise in channel strategy, operations, programs, enablement, and ecosystems.

Engagement types include Consulting, Contracting, or Fractional Channel Leadership depending on what's most appropriate for you and your organization.
